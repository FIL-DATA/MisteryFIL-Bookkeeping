## Description of Client Diligence

### 1. Diligence on clients
Every application has to go through a thorough evaluation process, where the more Datacap sought, the more thorough the examination will be.

**Manual due diligence involves:**
- **Identity verification**: KYC documents such as business licenses, business registration certificates, passport information files, etc.
- **Communication**: The business Manager will reach out to the applicant via email and set up 1-1 video/voice call for further check and review.
- **Compliance check**: Company's product types, business model, and news status through social media accounts, official websites, and other platforms.
- **Background check**: Client's business history, reputation, and experience.

### 2. Mitigation of Sybil Attacks
- **Rate Limiting**: Max one request per wallet every 14 days.  
- **Email Confirmation**: Required for first-time clients.  

### 3. List of survey questions
Additional questions (flexibly adapted based on the unique circumstances of the client):
- Could you provide background information about your company or yourself, co-owner, or directors, including links to your website and any pertinent online accounts?
- What is the source of the data, how much of it do you plan to preserve, and can you substantiate this claim?
- How do you want to store data initially? Which appropriate storage providers are you now in contact with? Please tell me each person's name.
- How would you go about submitting data to Filecoin?
- To guarantee compliance with its use, could you provide the actual usage situation of your Datacap allocation?
- What kind of data content do you save, and is it compliant with regional and federal laws?

### 4. Provide evidence and proof to the governance team on a regular basis
We understand the importance of transparency and adherence to FIL+ guidelines. To align with these principles, we will adopt a balanced approach regarding the public availability of diligence and client information. While recognizing the need for community transparency and ongoing auditing, we also acknowledge that specific details should remain accessible upon request by the Fil+ Governance team for dispute resolution or audits.

Our commitment involves publicly disclosing allocation decisions and review processes on GitHub, ensuring that the community remains informed about our activities while maintaining the confidentiality required for effective governance and dispute resolution.

## Dispute Resolutions
- **Regular checking**: Check the utilization of DataCap regularly.  
- **Track DataCap allocation metrics**: Utilize tools such as datacapstats.io, CID checker bots, etc. to monitor DataCap allocation and usage, focusing on key metrics such as DataCap residuals, allocation frequency, and more.  
- **Understand customer demographics**: Gather and analyze information about customer industry, size and storage behavior, geographic location, etc. to ensure diversity in DataCap allocation.  
- **Monitor time metrics**: Track time patterns of client DataCap usage, such as frequency and duration of use, to ensure proper allocation. Regularly assess whether clients are completing data storage and usage on time to manage DataCap effectiveness.  
- **Trust Assessment**: Conduct an initial trust assessment of new customers, including their historical credit history and business reputation. When they demonstrate compliance and reliability, their trust score, as well as their DataCap allocation, increases.  
- **Use tools such as CID Checker/Retrievability Bot**: Utilize tools such as CID Checker to validate the data stored by the client to ensure it matches the declared data. Retrievability bots can be used to monitor and verify the retrievability of data and ensure that clients are adhering to storage protocols.
